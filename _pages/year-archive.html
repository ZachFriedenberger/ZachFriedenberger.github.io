Here is where I post notes on recent papers I find relevent to my own research and some short essays on various topics in neuroscience, physics, and philosophy. 
For the paper summaries, my primary goal is to help you, the reader, understand each paper "line-by-line", filling the gaps that are often require further background reading or are assumed to be trivial. 

Feel free to leave comments or reach out if you find a mistake or simply want to say hi.
